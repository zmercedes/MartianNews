# NYT Take Home Project: Martian News
### An app by Zoilo Mercedes

This app was created using Xcode 10.1 and Swift 4.2. 
- The app has 3 views: 
-- a list of articles
-- an individual article view
-- a settings view, where you may change the language.
- The language is changed dynamically upon selecting one in the settings view.
- The language change is persisted across runs of the app using UserDefaults.

More Info on the app:
- It is implemented natively, without webviews.
- It uses cocoapods for dependency management and has SwiftLint added for style enforcement. 
- It uses a variety of design patterns, such as the Coordinator pattern, delegate pattern, MVC pattern, and observer pattern.
- It follows SOLID principles as closely as possible.
- It was profiled using Xcode's Instruments tool in order to avoid any retain cycles and/or memory leaks.
